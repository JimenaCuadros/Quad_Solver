1. Code for Quadratic solver in C.

2. System will prompt the user for input of A, B and C. System will check for valid input.
3. All numbers are normalized IEEE single precision numbers using scanf input.
4. Have version control system and standards for compiler, OS, language.
5. Return to the user if there is two real roots, or no real roots.
  If 2 real roots return as single precision values.
  If there is a problem with accuracy or precision, give the user a warning.
6. Unit Testing: Create unit tests for multiple parts of the program to ensure valid input and output.
7. Program to be coded in C and compiled with Makefile.
